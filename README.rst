## Install and run

1. Install with your favourite package manager:

    ```
    pip install django-magplan
    ```
    
    or
    
    ```
    pipenv install django-magplan
    ```
2. Add Magplan to Django `INSTALLED_APPS` in your projects `settings.py`:

    ```
    # Application definition
    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        ...
        'django.contrib.sessions',
        'django.contrib.messages',
        'django.contrib.staticfiles',
        'magplan'
    ]
    ```
3. Add Magplan to Django in your project `urls.py`:
    ```
    urlpatterns = [
        ...    
        path('plan/', include('magplan.urls')),
        
    ]
    ```
4. Go to `http://localhost:8080/plan/`.


Magplan requires Python 3.6+ and Postgres for minimal setup.

    postgresql_password: "<edit_this>"
    secret_key: "<edit_this>"
    ```
    
    and [Letâ€™s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) vars `ansible/group_vars/production`:
    
    ```
    environment_type:
    domain_name:
    letsencrypt_email:
    ```
3. Add your host to `/etc/ansible/hosts` like:
    ``` 
    [control]
    magplan_live ansible_host=magplan.example.com ansible_user=ubuntu
    ``` 
4. Run `ansible-playbook ansible/main.yml`
